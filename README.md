# DISCUS datasprint 9th July 2021

## Introduction

This repository contains some documents which may be useful for the unlocking data Sussex Integrated Dataset (SID) datasprint.

We will be exploring data from the SID and asking questions about the population, their demographics, and diagnoses. To this end, a few codelists are available here to try to find patients with certain conditions:

| Condition    | Filename                              | Comment                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hypertension | hypertension_datasprint_readcodes.csv |
| Cancer       | cancer_datasprint_readcodes.csv       | This includes breast, cervical, and colorectal malignant neoplasms           |
| Diabetes     | diabetes_datasprint_readcodes.csv     | This includes type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as codes for complications |

We may also want to explore aspects related to the GP practices, as well as where people live and so it may be helpful to have some information to lookup around neighbourhoods (Lower-layer super output area) and residential based deprivation

| Item                 | Filename             | Comment                                                                                                                                |
